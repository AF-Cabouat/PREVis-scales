# Perceived Readability Evaluation for Visualizations (PREVis) scales

This repository contains all the supplementary materials related to the development, validation, and implementation of PREVis.

## Root files
At the root of this folder are two PDF files:

- ```PREVis_full_paper.pdf```: PREVis publication (main paper with appendices).
- ```PREVis questionnaire companion.pdf```: A practical guide to PREVis with implementation recommendations and printable versions of the questionnaire.

## Folders organization
The folders are organized following phases of the instrument development and validation:

- ``` / Phase 1 - Item development```: material related to generation and validation of candidate items --- *see **section 4** in the paper.*
- ```/ Phase 2 - Scale development```: exploratory survey content, collected data, analysis notebooks and output tables and figures ---  *see **section 5** in the paper.*
- ```/ Phase 3 - Scale validation```: validation survey content, collected data, analysis notebooks and outputs tables and figures ---  *see **section 6** in the paper.*
- ```/ Main paper figures```: figures from the main paper in PDF format.
- ```/ Using PREVis - plotting results notebook and examples```: a folder containing example figures that researchers can plot to help analyze or present PREVis data. The folder also contains a Jupyter notebook named ```plotting_PREVis.ipynb``` and two example ```.csv``` datasets to plot all PDF figures in the folder.

## Companion OSF repositories

There are two other OSF repositories for this project:

- Studies pre-registrations on [osf.io/q4sdm](https://osf.io/q4sdm/?view_only=0ac76a186dfd47d298de145bad7cc861)
- Additional documents in [osf.io/aewuq](https://osf.io/aewuq/?view_only=1306e44a240541408ced0f5b547725f5): Full Research log and Methodology notes for cognitive interviews (pre-test in section 5 of the main paper). We separated these files because they contain embedded images that we cannot share under the CC BY licence.

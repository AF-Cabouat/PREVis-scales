## Folders organization
- [`research code`](research%20code/): this is the folder with all the code and data for reproducible steps of our research project.
- [`using PREVis`](using%20PREVis): if you want to use PREVis scales in a study, this is where we put all the resources you need. The folder contains a detailed PDF companion guide with a FAQ section and example study protocols. It also contains a folder with example data and code for visual analysis and presentation of your study results.

## Companion OSF repositories

A companion OSF repository was provided at the time of submission on [osf.io/9cg8j](https://osf.io/9cg8j/) for the original research project.

## Process to replicate Figures 4 and 5-bottom from the paper

The process for reproducing these figures relies on Jupyter Notebooks and is described in detail in a [dedicated readme file](research%20code/Replication%20-%20PREVis%20development%20figures/Notebooks/Readme%20-%20Notebooks%20-%20Exploratory%20survey%20data%20analysis.md), please see it and follow the instructions there.

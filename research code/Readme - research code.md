## Companion OSF repositories

There are three OSF repositories for this project:

- Original supplemental material on [osf.io/9cg8j](https://osf.io/9cg8j/)
- Studies pre-registrations on [osf.io/q4sdm](https://osf.io/q4sdm/)
- Additional documents in [osf.io/aewuq](https://osf.io/aewuq/): Full Research log and Methodology notes for cognitive interviews (pre-test in section 5 of the main paper). We separated these files because they contain embedded images that we cannot share under the CC BY licence.

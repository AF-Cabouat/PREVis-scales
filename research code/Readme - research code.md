# Code related to the research project

This folder contains the code related to the research work underpinning the development and validation of PREVis scales.

## Root files
At the root of this folder is the PREVis publication ```PREVis_full_paper.pdf```

## Folders organization
The folders are organized following phases of the instrument development and validation:

- ```/ Replication - PREVis development figures```: study data and notebooks to generate data analysis and figures for the development of PREVis ---  *see **section 5** in the paper.*
- ```/ Replication - PREVis validation figures```: input data and notebooks to generate data analysis and figures for the validation of PREVis ---  *see **section 6** in the paper.*

## Companion OSF repositories

There are three OSF repositories for this project:

- Studies pre-registrations on [osf.io/q4sdm](https://osf.io/q4sdm/)
- Original supplemental material under CC BY licence on [osf.io/9cg8j](https://osf.io/9cg8j/), including all data files, analysis code, and code outputs such as csv files and figures for the entire research project. Also contains all figures in the paper and companion guide.
- Additional documents in [osf.io/aewuq](https://osf.io/aewuq/): Full Research log and Methodology notes for cognitive interviews (pre-test in ***section 5*** of the main paper). We separated these files because they contain embedded images that we cannot share under the CC BY licence.

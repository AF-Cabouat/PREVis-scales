45247857963,"It's easy to understand, though not necessarily well organized or easy to browse. When I had to check if Grace and Monica had exchanged secrets, I spent a few seconds looking for Monica. I am by no means an expert though."
26379028454,Finally!
71484869893,"With the extra space, it could be helpful to add the number of connections each node has on the node itself"
84480827166,"This time, the visualization was so much more simple to understand!"
196822301272,"the vis is most comprehensive and clear in who-exchange-with.who secrets, more centered dots making a person whispering excessively, it the most clear vis graph by far, however, the straightline can be replaced with curves to avoid confusion in Eleanor, alice, leonard and Nathan, although it's already comprehensive that eleanor connecting to alice only, and leonard communicates to Nathan only"
160952659796,"The layout is very clear and well formatted. The low complexity of interactions is, of course, helping."
55753433481,"Season 1 is less crowded than season 2 and 3, this graph is way better to look at and to work with."
110352545132,This visualisation is much better than the previous one.
165850282516,I do not understand how Diana and Charlie relate to Leonard.
113530059245,"This was very clean not as crowded
 like the first visualization"
122883667271,"The visualization was easier to read this time

155095541778,"I think it would help if the characters that are the ""core"" (Alice and Leonard) of this visualization were more prominent."
96632369096,"The visualization lacks dynamics and outliers which would make it more interesting to ask about as alternative questions.

"
151499039122,This one is pretty clear and understandable with prior knowledge of how to read/understand it. 
213436625341,those familiar with social networks or related type of content might find it easier to interpret this type of visualization
172505022893,This representation is the best from far !!
37209589168,I suddenly got worried about whether indirect whispers were actually direct whispers in this visualization ... and the cross in the middle was slightly confusing ...Why put Diana across from Charlie in such a way as to intersect with the Alice-Leonard line?
162231603111,Way better in this form
112735934140,The cleared example of visualization yet. Clearly laid out to convey the data on a simple and clear manner. The questions still for and showcase that the survey needs to engage to confirm the clarity of the visualizing techniques.

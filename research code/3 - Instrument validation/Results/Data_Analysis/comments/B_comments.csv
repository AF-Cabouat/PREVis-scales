168101042569,"The left part is fine and clear, the right part is too condensed."
177126480936,"Too many connections between Leonard's friends in the visualisation make it a bit crowded, but that is often the case for these kinds of network representations."
138381221571,This one has been the easiest for me to see the data trends in so far.
45247857963,This makes my brain scream. It's crowded and impossible to read. Having to pull data from this would be hard work.
26379028454,"The lines are too densely packed to easily make judgements in some cases, eg. How many connections ssomeone like Rachel has."
69253389710,"Wright up says first season, questions refer to season 2?"
136216531257,"Some parts are confusing: Alice, for example, is connected to 7 people on the left. I don't know if that means Diana is connected to those people as well, or just to Alice."
84480827166,"I think the visualization seams fine to read, not messy, but just a little bit crowded."
196822301272,"this vis/graph was much much better than the previous, more organized, clean, more comprehensive than previous one with clusters of nodes."
160952659796,"The visualization is quite clear, but can get a little bit messy when the connection a thicker (eg: Leonard - Walter, overlapping a bit Monica), or with many nodes and connection (eg: Rachel in between of many connections)."
55753433481,this is slightly better and easier to read than season 3
110352545132,"Once again, using more colors would help."
165850282516,"Lines are overlapping, still overcrowded but much better that visualization 2"
113530059245,this was clean for the most part and only crowded in one part but overall readable
122883667271,"The visuals are a bit confusing because of the different colors so I was not sure which one was season 2 
"
155095541778,"The lines in the right node make it impossible to quantify the secrets. Could be more for Ursula than Monica or vice versa but it's impossible to discern. The whole section is too crowded and intricate, but the rest is not bad at all."
49059400266,"I can easily understand the left part of the visualization, its separeted from the others, you can easily retrieve and identify data, but the right side its super crowded that you barely can see anything"
96632369096,"More characters should be put to use for various questioning.
"
48534197366,It is a simple enough diagram to understand
133923348979,"my rating questions that I just answered are not correct. I have never click on that. For example, I said that I found this visualization crowded and quite messy. "
151499039122,The right side of the visualization is a bit crowded and might confuse people. 
180574313810,Having the Names of the Characters be more spread out would improve the visualization
213436625341,"Some ""don't's"" in the quesion framing  could create mistakes in the ratings with the agree-disagree scale"
37209589168,"Why are there two lines between Violet and Walter? I can sort of understand the Walter Sophie Quincy thing, but  ... oh, wait, perhaps the Violet thing is the same BUT the fact that there are two lines between Violet and Taylor is obscured by the label. So, yeah, maybe I do understand it - it's just too small.
"
162231603111,Only the corner ends are a bit messy but it is readable (Visually) 
112735934140,The visualization is more clearly layout then the previous example used. The questions are well layout to confirm intent and meaning for the visuals and what the survey is intended for.

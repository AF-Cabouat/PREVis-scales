168101042569,I cannot understand if some lines continue after a dot (person) or stop. This can lead to misleading results.
138381221571,"While the data is there if you spend some time looking at it, I find it a distracting and confusing way to see the data represented. Having to trace with a finger / mouse pointer etc rather than just being able to see what I want to see."
45247857963,"This one basically made me tap out. This is the sort of stuff you give an employee you wanna get rid of at a PIP, I suppose. Felt smart when I managed to notice that Taylor and Alice didn't share secrets though. I think, at least. This one's horrifyingly bad. Can't imagine most people would disagree."
26379028454,"The lines need to be unambiguously bbypassing nodes, or connecting to them. Alice for example has a thick line passsing through her node. Is it a cconnection, or just  passing ""by"" her?"
69253389710,"You refer to first season, in the wright up but season 3 in the questions..."
136216531257,"Some connections are unclear, e.g. there is a line from Alice to Walter to Taylor. I don't know if this means Alice has a connection to Taylor. Overall, it's very cluttered."
125631530338,The visualization is too crowded and the names are too close from one another
71484869893,This diagram could be greatly improved by rearranging nodes; the problem is not with the type of graph itself.
84480827166,"This one was very messy, compared to the others."
196822301272,"this vis is a bit messy, dots having different colors are mixed, challenging to find the wanted information although it was clear and comprehensive what vis communicated, it's just hard to explore the information. Hoping more structured vis, clustered by color and connecting lines could be curves, straight lines from taylor, water, and alice may be misinterpreted as direct connection between taylor and alice although it is not"

160952659796,"This forest is pretty hard to read, with several overlaps"
55753433481,"The graph is a bit messy, but the dots give you a clearer indication on where to look and find the activity that way who connected the most and with who."
110352545132,"The visualization is unreadable, because all connections have the same color. Using different colors would surely made it more clear."

165850282516,"Very crowded, I understand the representation but can not see the line clearly as they overlap"
113530059245,"The data on the visualization is not that messy and not difficult for me to read data on it
"
122883667271,"The visualization is a bit messy and confusing
"
155095541778,It is very much crowded and the line from Alice to Taylor could overlapping with a line from Walter to Taylor.
96632369096,"The significance of the thickness in the connection lines is unknown to me.
"
100549813061,Some parts of the visualization is difficult to read
48534197366,Certainly more crowded and unclear
133923348979,"Again, this answers are not the one that I chose. I find this visualization crowded and messy"
6664303897,"The lines on the diagram is clear but if the thinner line was d
arcker then the task at hand would be more better "
151499039122,It's messy and if I was seeing it for the first time it wouldn't be easy to extract info from it.

188678630831,"In that case, if the image/diagram were slightly larger it might be easier to read."
37209589168,"It's hard to tease out the activity of the more active whisperers, though it seems always possible to follow them if you make an effort. If the whole thing were larger it would be easier."
162231603111,To Cluttered 
112735934140,"The visualization is a very messy and confusing and needs a bit of focused work before finding the information required to answer the questions. The rating questions are clear in what is being requested. The questions are well layout in respect towards the visualization being used and what specific data is needed to be conveyed for the user.

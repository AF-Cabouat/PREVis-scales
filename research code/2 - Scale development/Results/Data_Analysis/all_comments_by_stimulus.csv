answer,5,1,2,,,1,1,"Graph is verloades with information,even the colour distictions doesn't help much for a quick overview of the stand of matters.","I can answer but I'm not sure I'm correct.

It actually took me a while to understand this family tree. Not having the information about what ""F"" meant, or direct links between the parents to their children made it confusing, but after a while I understood the separation in the columns and finally understood everything. So it wasn't easy at first, it was very confusing, but now I'd say I can hopefully answer any question about it.",,,"this shows that with the visualization , we can easily know when the price of fruits going high.",hard to see the exact number.
clearData,3,1,1,,,,1,I'm not too sure if I'm reading it the right. There was a question asking about accessory sales in Q1. The option I was given did not match with what I was reading from the graph so I'm not sure if it's me or what.,it feels too messy and I wish that perhaps different colours were used instead of shapes to differentiate between genders.,,,,please see my previous answer  I'll probably time out if I have to type it again but it said something isn't right here these increments are supposed to be fine tuned Right? Because that's Mbps And you already know that's clear so that's not what's going on in this study LOL right i'm not going crazy here right? .
clearRepresent,3,,1,,1,,1,,It doesnt seperate each couple and their children.,,boundaries .,,Kind of since most of the results have decimal numbers that cannot be deduced with accuracy.
distinguish,11,3,2,2,2,,2,"Some colour looks the same, hard to differentiate.

I can distinguish the different elements. At the same time I can see how someone can make errors in trying to distinguish the different elements. Some of the colors are a bit similar.

No, they blend into each other too much.","It doesnt make sense when it comes to how each set of kids each grandparents have.

I think genders you've made clear but collums are not clear to me.","I can see the lines but the color choices make it hard to tell which is which .

but there are no dots in this questionaire.","I would struggle to answer questions about the countries that are not labelled as my geography knowledge is not detailed enough.

If the countries are not identified by text, it might be difficult for the user to identify that country without looking up a map.",,"It just erased my answer and I just spent this time and wrote it out i'm I'm an overthinker and I'm starting to overthink this and I'm probably gonna end up timing out the way I'm seeing it is of course you know already it's clear to see but what are you really asking is my question..Mbps  Even a small tiny increment is a significant difference is that what we're getting out here because it's not labeled by little increment I think that's what we're getting at if not I'm sorry but I've been overthinking this for a little bit now and something isn't right here LOL I think that must be what it is or I'm close  .

There is only one representation - unicoloured Bars."
effect,4,,2,1,,,1,,"Perhaps effectively, yes, especially after understanding it, it's an organized and neat visualization, but it can prove difficult to understand in the first place.

Notes: The meaning of the letter ""F"" is not explained, thus making it difficult to figure out the family ties between the people displayed. Also, the horizontal layout is more difficult to read than the more usual vertical one.",colours not plain enough.,,,I don't know how to answer the question these are supposed to be fine tuned mbps is a significant difference I'm overthinking it and I'm ruining the study.
find,2,1,,,,,1,Some are easier than others. Some are a bit more difficult e.g. Art sales.,,,,,i'm not sure what specific elements are meant here.
identifi,3,,,2,,,1,,,"It's not that easy to identify the exact gradient corresponding to the data; it's doable but not that easy or quick .

I am able to read the chart, however the colors can be a little confusing at times as some of have the same shade of colors . therefore i would have to look very carefully in order to determine a certain category .",,,Please see my previous answer if not that isn't the answer then yes strongly agree would be my secondary answer .
organiz,5,2,1,1,,,1,"The contrast between the colours is very little, which can be slightly confusing.

There are too many lines on this plot and it is very crowded.","I just understood how to read the visualization and now it makes sense, but on the previous questions it didn't at all.",It could be better.,,,would be better if it followed a certain pattern (alphabetical order or from highest to lowest).
read,9,1,2,4,1,,1,the lines are too close together.,"'F' does not make sense nor is included  in the legend.

Not quite sure on the meaning of this. I can literally read it (as in, read the words) without a problem. I cannot understand the data very well.","its too hard to see the colours.

It's not that I find reading the visualization difficult, but the color gradients are distracting.

It is easy to read the chart as it represented in different colors and in a pie chart. I find pie charts the easiest to read as they display information in a simple format.

I can easily read it, but block colours would make it slightly quicker to decipher.","The fact that not all countries have the names written can be misleading, meanwhile the color coding seems fine .",,"Again to to precise, shpwingb the actual number on the bar would be great."
readabl,6,,2,2,,1,1,,"It's complex. But I think I'm slowly starting to understand although I am not entirely sure.

I think its bit easier now but on first look it did not seem readable. Took me a few minutes to make it seem readable.","its too hard to read.

If by readable you mean that I can tell what each segment is representing, then no, it's not very readable.",,Downgraded as slight guesstimates have to be done for mid week prices.,Placing the actual number on the graph line would be better. I can see the numbers but I do have estimate the number when it is not exactly on the line.
simpl,6,1,2,2,,,1,the lines ar too similar colour and too close.,"It is simple to read but not to understand clearly who is related to who.

No clear indication of relations.","colours arent clear.

Again, not so easy to identify the correct gradient (because of similar colors) at first glance.",,,please see my previous answer  I'll probably time out if I have to type it again but it said something isn't right here these increments are supposed to be fine tuned Right?

valu,11,,4,3,3,,1,,"I cannot put a value without a number.

I agree I can read the data but I'm not 100% on it .

data includes male and female indicators.

I don't think there are data values in this visualization since this is a family tree; but I can easily distinguish who is male and who is female.","There are no values shown.

There are no data values displayed, only colored areas.

I don't have the percentage of each parameter, but I can understand more or less which parameter has the highest and lowest percentage.","Labels require me to focus closely to see .

Can read ranges, but not values.

I can have an idea of the range of the value for a given country, but i have to refer to the color scheme below to do so (the colors aren't very easy to decipher).",,I can come close to the actual number but it would be an estimate only.
complex,7,,3,3,,1,,,"I t ins't complex to read but to understand.

It was initially very complex to read, but once you have figured it out, it is easier to read and extract information.

It's easy to read, it's just not easy to decipher the familiar links.","I think the color gradients make it seem more complex than it is, the data itself is simpler than the visualization.

i like the graph type, but the color choices are very odd.

It is easy to read but the colour choices makes it hard to decide which categorie matches the part of the pie chart.",,All these horizontal lines do not make the graph easily usable.,
deciph,4,1,,2,,1,,Too messy.,,"i can understand the data, but the colors make the interpretation slower.

i think the colors for ""Recreation"" and ""Transport"" are kind off confusings.",,Hovering on a section to give the exact price might be more helpful.,
distract,4,,1,,1,2,,,I find the 'F' distracting as it is not clear what it means.,,labels are little lost.,"The intersecting grid and the yellow representation of kiwi can be difficult due to the opacity of the colour, it can kind of blend in.

The horizontal grey bars are slighty distracting to me.",
lost,4,1,2,,,1,,There is definitely a lot going on in the graph but I think I am able to read it. The cumulative sales and the  average represented by the dashed straight line. .,"I did initially but the more i look at it i totally understand it.

The family tree above has less information in it and its really hard to  see who are siblings as it does not show on the above information.",,,"For the most part, I'm sometimes lost when trying to view the apples  though. .",
messi,2,1,,,,1,,I think maybe there could be a better way but its still possible to read it.,,,,Maybe I would have picked different colours less similar to each other (like replacing either the yellow with red).,
see,6,1,2,,2,1,,"Again, a lot of the data is interwoven, making it hard to read.","I don't really understand the question setting.

I don't think there is a trend/minimum/maximum/an outlier in this visualization because it is a family tree.",,"It's clear to see data which applies to geographically large countries, but difficult or impossible to see what applies to small countries!.

There's not really a trend or outlier visible.",I do not see an outlier.,
confus,4,2,,1,1,,,"Some of the colours are difficult to differentiate.

At first, yes. After 30 seconds, no. .",,The colours make it a little distracting. .,"It isn't confusing in that it's hard for me to decipher, but some elements do feel odd—for instance, only certain countries are labelled compared to others.",,
inform,2,,1,,1,,,,I had to go back to confirm that the 2 columns next to the grandparents represented each relationship and that the corresponding collumns against the children of the grandparents were determining the parentage of this generation.,,labels.,,
obvious,7,,6,,1,,,,"When you look at it for the first time, it takes a while to decipher because we're used to seeing family trees develop horizontally (from top to bottom) and not laterally (from left to right). On the other hand, replacing the symbols with squares and balls also makes it difficult to read.

Took  a minute to understand this chart.

This format is novel to me, and it took me a couple of minutes to grasp.

it needs a bit more scrutiny to understand fully.

 I disagree because it took far to long to figure out and even now i'm not 100% sure. .

Lack of specification of connection between people is the confusing part. (a.k.a who are the parents of the student's father and mother and the connection of the other people).",,It says number of students but is it number of students per head of population?.,,
represent,5,,2,2,1,,,,"it took me 5 minutes just looking at it to understand this table.

I can now after having a longer look but on first impressions it was not easy to understand. .","colours are confuzed.

The data is easy to read, but the color choice of the pie chart is not good.","The shades are a bit too similar, I can distinguish them but its a little hard from each subsequent group. For example, 101-1000 is easy to tell from 0, but a bit difficult to tell between 26-100 or >1000.",,
understandQuick,6,1,1,3,1,,,Too many data on one graphic too obtain a quick understanding.,"Not really, I had to think about how the kids of grandparents are developed.","it takes time to understand.

I can quickly understand it, but determining the different colours with the legend is hard as they are quite similar.

i have only now just started to get it .",The colour differences are a bit subtle and I find myself referring to the key more often than may be ideal.,,
visibl,6,1,3,1,1,,,i can see te line spaces just enough.,"There is no numerical data available in this study.

There is no trend or so in the data.

I don't think there is a trend/a minimum/maximum/an outlier in this visualization since this is a family tree.",I can but I hate this pie chart.  I would immediately send this back to the proper department and have them make a solid pie chart along with the actual data not this junky thing.,"Not really a trend or anything special in the graph visible. Just shows pure numbers, no distribution or so.",,
confid,4,1,2,1,,,,"It is not so easy to follow, because many lines are similar colours and they are very close to each other, but I do understand the visualization.","Agree now mostly but i'm still a little unsure.

Now after looking at it a bit more I am, but I had a bit of trouble in the beginning.","i understand the information, but the colors turn the process slower, it would be easier if you used 1 color instead of a gradient.",,,
crowd,2,,,2,,,,,,"I wouldn't say crowded. The color scheme is a bit harder to understand. Even for people with regular vision, it might be hard to differentiate between the less contrasting slices.

Too many colors can be confusing.",,,
meanElem,3,,1,2,,,,,"Not sure what the ""F"" stands for though...","The gradients, as opposed to flat colours, make it hard to tell between some of the categories, and to find any particular category quickly.

Multi coloured pie charts are very messy and takes time to study to make sure each correlates.  solid coloured pie charts are absolutely the best with tried and true results.  Don't try and fix that which is not broken.",,,
meanOveral,3,1,1,1,,,,The only problem of the graph is the color contrast of elements presented.,"I slightly disagree I actually found it hard to figure out and the answers I gave, I'm not 100% were correct. .",Some of the colours are too similar  when the pie slices are small and it makes it difficult to know which is which because the key is not large enough. key.,,,
understandEasi,3,,1,2,,,,,Similar to earlier answer I think its easier now to understand (maybe if I have figured it out correct) but orginally this was hard to understand.,"I fully understand how it's trying to convey it, but I have difficulty interpreting it.

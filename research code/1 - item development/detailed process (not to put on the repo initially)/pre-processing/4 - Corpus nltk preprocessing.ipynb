       "  'The evaluation participants replied that the OPCPs ”can be very strong in structure detection in the data”, especially ”when there is a lot of overlap in the data”. However, ”the OPCPs take more time to get used to” and ”might require some training for na¨ıve users”. Also, finding ”simple correlations across dimensions can be easier sometimes with PCPs only”. O-Brushing makes it ”easier to select patterns locally”, but ”O-Prober could be improved by using also different shapes, other than the rectangle”. Most users commented that our approach supported them more in the identification and selection of patterns and outliers, in particular. For simple cases, due to the fact that OPCPs require prior familiarization and training, they might be less suitable. However, for cluttered data, the advantages are straightforward.',\n",

Several participants reported: “I answered sometimes with a very low confidence, close to luck.”\\n2D curve was found to have fewer overlaps than 2D straight. However, many participants reported the curvature made it difficult to follow lines, and sometimes, the curvature was found to be unexpected, which apparently increased difficulty.\\n(...)\\n3D distance was easy to distinguish flows. “This one left enough gaps between the curves to clearly distinguish the curves” and “it was visually appealing.” However, a few participants commented they felt more confident with 3D quantity, and a few commented that this might be due to the double encoding used by 3D quantity (3D quantity encodes quantity with height and width).\\n(...)\\nGlobe was found to be the most intuitive.

       "  'Expressive Visual Design Improve Data Comprehension\\nParticipants also provided other positive comments on DataShot’s visual design. They all agreed the visualization presented in DataShot is easy to understand. Participants commented regarding the visual design that “...(DataShot) provides meaningful annotations for me to understand the data better” (P1, male, 22), and “the short description (of each fact sheet elements) helps me dive into the content of the data” (P3, male, 22). At the same time, participants commented on the expressiveness of DataShot, “The visual design is quite rich...I have plenty of choices to show the data from different aspects” (P9, female, 29). Moreover, participants also commented on the attractiveness of the fact sheet design. “I got a rough idea after I read the data, but DataShot presents the data in a more thought-provoking and eye-catching way” (P9, female, 29). One participant (P7, male, 22) noted, “I want to copy the charts into my presentation slides”. However, participants also pointed out that such an auto-generated process could diminish the diversity and decrease the creativity of the final output, which could hamper the expressiveness.',\n",
       "  'Participant Feedback.\\nAt the end of the experiment each participant was given the chance to provide feedback and give comments. Some participants felt Prot´eg´e was more familiar and acceptable, e.g., commenting “The vertical aligned indented list is easier to perceive hierarchy structures”. Most of the participants gave positive feedback for OntoPlot, e.g., commenting “OntoPlot interface is more friendly”, “OntoPlot needs effort to learn, but makes tasks easier”, or “OntoPlot has more compact view of the ontology”. Some participants also provided more specific feedback such as “Lighter lines and darker lines are helpful for distinguishing siblings and non-siblings”, “The labels make finding associations much easier”, “Association labels are easy to read”, or “Tagging feature is nice”. One participant also commented on Prot´eg´e: “That is very difficult to find common ancestors with Prot´eg´e”.  A few participants also provided helpful feedback for further improvements  of OntoPlot, e.g., “Probably can use colour coding for the sibling lines to make them more obvious”, “The subtle arrows could be more effective if can indicate the number of pointing in and pointing out associations”, or “Probably can filter association classes further when there are many associations”.',\n",

Given that we use the scatterplot as our visualization, they found it easy for them to recognize the images and their similarities. However, one user indicated that the estimation of image similarities was not so easy, as the visualization can be explored in different scales, which sometimes hampered his estimation of the distances. Another user mentioned that it would be more useful if the images can be visualized temporally for the task of image management. In addition, three users made comments about the color. One of them thought the color is appropriate, which provided her an impression of the starry sky. Two of them thought the color is a little confusing as it did not well distinguish between different semantic clusters. Due to the limitation of our clustering method, however, some semantically similar images may be assigned to different groups. Moreover, one user thought that it was not efficient to show all the text in the same size. He hoped that important words could be highlighted by a larger text to attract his attention.',\n",

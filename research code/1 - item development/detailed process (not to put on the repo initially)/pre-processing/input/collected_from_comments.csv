"We also collected written comments from our participants. Eight participants expressed that LineSets were better for identifying intersections of sets and looking for common attributes between two elements. Ten participants expressed Bubble Sets as not being suitable for these tasks.

Participants were divided over the size comparison task: 6 expressed their preference for LineSets, 6 for Bubble Sets. We observed that participants who actually counted the set elements preferred LineSets, while participants who tried to estimate the size of sets preferred Bubble Sets. Two participants expressed that Bubble Sets gave them a better sense of “grouping”, yet one still preferred LineSets for the tasks they performed in the experiment.

Several participants commented that single continuous lines were tortuous and difficult to follow when intersecting with others. They commented that when they got lost, they went back to the beginning of the line and resumed the counting, which may partly explain the decrease of performance using LineSets.",better; suitable; difficult; follow; lost,maps; node-links;,https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.186
Participants’ feedback from the questionnaire was also clearly against the superimposed chart and it was ranked lowest by all but one participant. Participants called it very confusing and demanding too much concentration or reflection to decipher the non-monotonic and discontinuous nature of the two scales. One participant commented that the different visual markers which were necessary to depict data in this chart were a major reason for his confusion.,decipher; confusing;,charts;,https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2011.160
"The major benefits of RelEx most frequently stated by our participants were the overview RelEx provides, the rich and usable exploration opportunities, its comprehensibility, the ability to easily communicate with colleagues using RelEx, and the ability to speed up and simplify a variety of their daily tasks.

Four participants also particularly stressed the value of the SignalPath View as it shows all relevant elements of signal paths in an easily understandable and usable way, while with previous tools this information had to be derived with a manual stepby- step process.",rich; usable; comprehensibly; easily; simplicity; speed; understandable;,node-links;,https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.255
"Based on free response questions and interviews with the moderator, participants felt overall that Outflow was “pretty”, “looks cool”, and that the colors were “very meaningful”. They said that it provides a “good high level view” that encodes a lot of information into a single “simple to follow” visualization. In addition, users felt that the ability to see outcome associated with alternative paths out of (or into) a given state, and not just the state itself, is a powerful feature. “I like the difference between states and transitions [which allowed me] to compare two paths to the same state and to understand differences.” Another participant commented that “highlighting of paths was very helpful.”",meaningful; view; simple; understand; helpful,paths;,https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2012.189
"We categorized the difficult aspects described by our participants into two major areas: cross-boundary edges and nesting. Nine out of 14 participants commented that the cross-boundary edges (especially from a node inside a module to a different module) were the most difficult aspect of these diagrams. Five participants explicitly said that these were the most likely cause of their errors. Four of our 14 participants identified nesting as causing them problems; three of these did not mention the cross-boundary edges at all. Finally, one participant commented that, at first, the most confusing aspect of these diagrams was the affordance of the visual grouping into modules. He explained that such grouping naturally conveyed to him that nodes within a module are directly connected (clique). While training helped, he struggled against this instinctive decoding of the diagram throughout the trials.",difficult; ,node-links;,https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.151
"Six audience participants chose PowerPoint as a preferred system mainly because of the readability. They mentioned that PowerPoint was “easier to read,” “legible,” and “easier to see and read.” Another reason by two audience participants was familiarity. For example, P14 stated that “The ease of visibility understanding the flow, the cleanness of the graphics in each slide the boldness of the fonts much easier to follow along with it as I was more familiar with it.”
(...)
Some audience participants preferred PowerPoint because SketchStory looked untidy and cluttered for them. Furthermore, one major issue with SketchStory for the audience was readability; each chart did not have a title like a PowerPoint slide and the fonts for the numbers and labels were too small. An audience participant mentioned that it would be nice to have the capability of maximizing one chart since it would alleviate the readability problem. It could be helpful to incorporate existing sketch beautification algorithms and to support adaptive font size.",readability; easy to see; easy to read; legible; ease of visibility; understand; clean; bold; untidy; cluttered;,charts;,https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2013.191
"Comparing diff to side-by-side, PD08 said “it’s [side-by-side] a lot easier to tell what the overall latency is for each operation. . . . [the nodes are] all put together without any gaps in the middle.” SD09 said, “With [side-by-side], I can more easily see this is happening here before and after. Without the dashed lines, you can’t see which event in the previous trace corresponds to the after trace.”

"Hiding arrows using A and EA, if important structures would be occluded, made sense to all participants. However, for this task, it was confusing because direction information was missing in dense regions. This indicates that the correctness could have suffered because the participants started guessing. In contrast, the completion time might have been increased because it takes longer to come to a decision. Visualization with C and T can be recognized very well in dense regions; this is especially true for T because it is very simple. These two methods are also reported to be pleasant, since they guide the eyes. The direction encoding with C was not intuitive for some participants.

The participants commented that the splats used in SP made it hard to decide between two similar clusters because there is nearly no difference in brightness. However, the SP enabled them to identify locations within a cluster where several points are very close to each other. Some had the feeling that they solved the task faster when NSP was used.

"The evaluation participants replied that the OPCPs ”can be very strong in structure detection in the data”, especially ”when there is a lot of overlap in the data”. However, ”the OPCPs take more time to get used to” and ”might require some training for na¨ıve users”. Also, finding ”simple correlations across dimensions can be easier sometimes with PCPs only”. O-Brushing makes it ”easier to select patterns locally”, but ”O-Prober could be improved by using also different shapes, other than the rectangle”. Most users commented that our approach supported them more in the identification and selection of patterns and outliers, in particular. For simple cases, due to the fact that OPCPs require prior familiarization and training, they might be less suitable. However, for cluttered data, the advantages are straightforward.",strong; easy;,parallel plot;,https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467872

"Lessons Learned from the Readability Study
The results of our user study indicate that story curves are easily graspable. A number of participants commented that it is fun and enjoyable to learn about story curves; e.g., P5: “[...] a lot of fun!”, P10: “[...] an interesting experiment to understand narrative and story in graphics.”, and P11: “I was able to recognize Memento’s curve. It is a totally fascinating idea.”. Some participants struggled to understand the design of story curves; e.g, P3: “Putting the origin at the upper left corner was initially disorientating”, P9: “I needed to remind myself that one thing is narrative and the other is chronological.”",understand; recognize; disorientating;,strorylines;,https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744118
"2D straight was found to be easy for small data sets, however, lines were found to be hard to distinguish due to increasing overlaps in large data sets. Several participants reported: “I answered sometimes with a very low confidence, close to luck.”
2D curve was found to have fewer overlaps than 2D straight. However, many participants reported the curvature made it difficult to follow lines, and sometimes, the curvature was found to be unexpected, which apparently increased difficulty.
(...)
3D distance was easy to distinguish flows. “This one left enough gaps between the curves to clearly distinguish the curves” and “it was visually appealing.” However, a few participants commented they felt more confident with 3D quantity, and a few commented that this might be due to the double encoding used by 3D quantity (3D quantity encodes quantity with height and width).

"In the discussion and the questionnaires, the experts stated that they liked “to have an overview over a whole dataset” and “to instantly see what the group does over time”. They found the technique to be “exciting” and one of them was particularly positive about being able to see the feature development in combination with the feature distribution amongst the entities, comparing it to “the usual averaged line chart” the experts employ. On the downside, some participants stated troubles with interpreting the detailed spatial development, which one of them found “difficult to learn” and another “hard to abstract the movement” from individuals to the whole group from a cognitive point of view.",overview; instantly; interpret; hard; cognitive,motion patterns;,https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864907
"Expressive Visual Design Improve Data Comprehension
Participants also provided other positive comments on DataShot’s visual design. They all agreed the visualization presented in DataShot is easy to understand. Participants commented regarding the visual design that “...(DataShot) provides meaningful annotations for me to understand the data better” (P1, male, 22), and “the short description (of each fact sheet elements) helps me dive into the content of the data” (P3, male, 22). At the same time, participants commented on the expressiveness of DataShot, “The visual design is quite rich...I have plenty of choices to show the data from different aspects” (P9, female, 29). Moreover, participants also commented on the attractiveness of the fact sheet design. “I got a rough idea after I read the data, but DataShot presents the data in a more thought-provoking and eye-catching way” (P9, female, 29). One participant (P7, male, 22) noted, “I want to copy the charts into my presentation slides”. However, participants also pointed out that such an auto-generated process could diminish the diversity and decrease the creativity of the final output, which could hamper the expressiveness.",easy; understand; meaningful; present (?);,fact sheets;,https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934784
"Participant Feedback.
At the end of the experiment each participant was given the chance to provide feedback and give comments. Some participants felt Prot´eg´e was more familiar and acceptable, e.g., commenting “The vertical aligned indented list is easier to perceive hierarchy structures”. Most of the participants gave positive feedback for OntoPlot, e.g., commenting “OntoPlot interface is more friendly”, “OntoPlot needs effort to learn, but makes tasks easier”, or “OntoPlot has more compact view of the ontology”. Some participants also provided more specific feedback such as “Lighter lines and darker lines are helpful for distinguishing siblings and non-siblings”, “The labels make finding associations much easier”, “Association labels are easy to read”, or “Tagging feature is nice”. One participant also commented on Prot´eg´e: “That is very difficult to find common ancestors with Prot´eg´e”.  A few participants also provided helpful feedback for further improvements  of OntoPlot, e.g., “Probably can use colour coding for the sibling lines to make them more obvious”, “The subtle arrows could be more effective if can indicate the number of pointing in and pointing out associations”, or “Probably can filter association classes further when there are many associations”.",easy; perceive; helpful; distinguish; coding; obvious;  effective,matrices;,https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934557

"Reviewing open-ended feedback showed us that difficulty under standing was attributed to unfamiliarity with a visualization: “It was somewhat challenging because I’m not familiar with this type of graph. Additionally, the abstract nature of our graph systems, and also novelty effects influenced difficulty. P111 says, “Their abstract nature was the most difficult to understand. Observing this with a real life example would make it easier to visualize and conceptualize.” Finally, our participants indicated that they used both visualization and narratives for causal inference: “I think having both the summary and the color coded chart makes it much easier to understand [...].”",difficult; understand; easy; visualize; conceptualize;,node-links; color-coded text;,https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030358
"participants commented that the linear design helped them browsing elements (H4). On the contrary, 7 out of 13 commented on the fact that the lines were “wiggly and visually distracting when counting the elements”, “intersecting in a confusing way” and “hard to tell apart”. A few participants also commented that they would get lost following the lines and had to start counting again from the beginning.

"Visual Design.

Most of the users agreed that our visual design could intuitively convey the semantic information. Given that we use the scatterplot as our visualization, they found it easy for them to recognize the images and their similarities. However, one user indicated that the estimation of image similarities was not so easy, as the visualization can be explored in different scales, which sometimes hampered his estimation of the distances. Another user mentioned that it would be more useful if the images can be visualized temporally for the task of image management. In addition, three users made comments about the color. One of them thought the color is appropriate, which provided her an impression of the starry sky. Two of them thought the color is a little confusing as it did not well distinguish between different semantic clusters. Due to the limitation of our clustering method, however, some semantically similar images may be assigned to different groups. Moreover, one user thought that it was not efficient to show all the text in the same size. He hoped that important words could be highlighted by a larger text to attract his attention.",intuitively; easy; hamper; useful; appropriate; confusing; distinguish; efficient; highlight; attract attention;,multiple types; point-based; text-based;,https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2835485

"The majority of the participants pre- ferred C the most because of its ""simple shape."" They found the shape of glyph A and B to be ""complex"" as the superquadric glyphs took a concave shape for the indefinite tensors. Some participants commented that they did not find it necessary to highlight indefinite tensors through this change in shape. Many participants said because of the ""simple shape"" of C it was easier to learn C compared to A and B. Few users found that the ""pointy feature"" of glyph A and B for indefinite tensors helped in better estimating the principal directions compared to the ""convex or rounded shape"" of C.

Compared to the icons, I definitely prefer to look at the visualizations.”-P1-2 “I looked at the peak of the waves of the scrolling speed just to double-check what was happening.”-P6-1 Also, P3-1 thought the scrolling speed was useful, but would like to see numbers instead of a relative scale from “slow” to “fast.” 

However, these two features were relatively less used. One reason was that “they are too far away from the video so while I’m watching the video I couldn’t see that information.”-P2-2 In addition, P4-2 mentioned “I didn’t really look at the scrolling speed, because I think this is not super relevant to this task.”

We implemented this feature after the user study. Besides those neutral and negative assessments, participants considered that “the integration of all layouts facilitated the analysis and each brought a different aspect of the network being analyzed”.
